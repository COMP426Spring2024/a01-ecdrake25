                        <p>In Greek Mythology, the Titans are said to be the first generation of Gods. 
                            They are massive, powerful creatures that have superhuman strength and speed. 
                            Uranus and Gaea were the primordial gods of Heaven and Earth who gave birth to the 
                            Titans. They produced twelve immortal brothers and sisters who had strong capabilities.
                             For instance, Oceanus was the Titan of the ocean and water, Rhea was the Titaness of 
                             fertility and motherhood, and Cronus was the Titan of time and the ages.  Along with 
                             the Titans, Uranus and Gaea produced another race of beings called Giants. Each of 
                             these Giants possessed a hundred hands and fifty hands. Fearing the power and strength
                              of these creatures, Uranus banished his Giant offspring to the hell-like dungeon of 
                              the Gods called Tartarus. Heartbroken by Uranus’ actions, Gaea conspired with her 
                              Titan children to dethrone their father. Cronus led the battle and was able to 
                              complete the task. However, before being defeated by his son, Uranus cursed Cronus 
                              to the same fate, saying that he, too, would one day be defeated by his son. Cronus 
                              was crowned ruler but ruled in fear that his father’s prophecy would ring true. He 
                              tried everything to prevent this prophecy and even resorted to swallowing his 
                              children to keep them in his stomach. Gaea was able to protect one of his children, 
                              Zeus, by hiding him away. Zeus worked with Gaea to orchestrate a plan to release his 
                              siblings and overthrow his father. The six siblings, Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, 
                              Poseidon, and Zeus were considered Olympians, not Titans. They declared war on their 
                              father and defeated him after a 10-year war between the Titans and Olympians called 
                              Titanomachia. Zeus then sent all of the Titans to Tartarus.</p>

                    The overthrow of the Titans by the Olympians proved to be a historical turn, considering the many modern day references to the Olympians
                    compared to that of the Titans. For instance: </p>
                    <div class="hold">

                        <li>The famous sports apparel company Nike is named after the goddess of victory, Nike</li>
                        <li>Nasa's Apollo Program which landed the first man on the moon was named after the Greek god of light, music, and the sun.</li>
                        <li>In fact, many of NASA's missions are named after Greek Gods</li>

                    These are examples of many modern day references to the Olympians. But where have we seen the portrayal of Titans in the media?
