            <p>This series shows the true power of the Titans. Humanity was forced to build towering walls around their civilation
                to protect from these creatures. They built armies to train and learn how to fight Titans beyond the walls. 
                Although their main concern for the last 100 years was learning how to defeat standard, mindless Titans 
                known as pure Titans, they are quickly faced with the realization that some of them are far from mindless.
                In fact, nine of them have what's called The Power of The Titans and have abilities given from the Gods.
                I believe that this is an interesting rendition of the Twelve original Titans that descended from Gaea and Uranus.
